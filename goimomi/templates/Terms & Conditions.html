          <!-- Accuracy -->
          <h2>Accuracy of content &amp; product information</h2>
          <p>We strive for accuracy but typographical errors may occur. If a product is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information, we reserve the right to modify the price or refuse/cancel orders placed for that product unless the product has already been dispatched.</p>

          <!-- Outstanding -->
          <h2>Outstanding</h2>

          <!-- Cancellation -->
          <h2 id="cancellation">Cancellation policy</h2>
          <p>All cancellations must be notified in writing. Cancellation charges apply from the date we receive written notice, according to the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>45 days prior to departure: 10% of the ticket cost</li>
            <li>15 days prior to departure: 25% of the ticket cost</li>
            <li>72 hours prior to departure: No refund</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Cancellation within 12 hours of scheduled departure must be handled directly with the airline. Cancellations submitted on Sundays will be processed on the next working day. During festival days certain payments may be non-refundable. No refunds will be provided for cancellations after trip commencement.</p>

          <h3>Airline cancellation policy</h3>
          <p>Airline fares are governed by the airline's fare rules. Most airfares are non-refundable and non-transferable and airlines may charge partial or full cancellation fees. We will help wherever possible within those rules.</p>

          <h3>Additional cancellation &amp; amendment conditions</h3>
          <p>Certain suppliers (air, car, hotel, tour) may apply additional cancellation penalties or amendment fees; such terms will be clearly advised at time of booking and are displayed on the relevant product page.</p>

          <!-- Liabilities -->
          <h2>Our liabilities &amp; limitations</h2>
          <p>If ticket costs or taxes increase due to government changes after booking, such increases will be charged additionally. We act as an agent for airlines and other suppliers; all contracts, tickets and receipts issued are subject to the terms of those suppliers. Itineraries are samples and subject to change due to weather, road conditions, participant ability, or other factors beyond our control. We are not responsible for damages or compensation claims arising from such changes beyond our control.</p>

          <!-- Travel insurance -->
          <h2>Travel insurance</h2>
          <p>We strongly recommend comprehensive travel insurance covering medical expenses, cancellation, personal injury, loss/theft of luggage and personal belongings. Please ensure the policy meets your individual needs.</p>
